# Welcome to MDebugger Page
MDebugger is a model-level debugger of [PapyrysRT](https://eclipse.org/papyrus-rt/) (Papyrus for Real-time). Papyrus-RT is an Eclipse-based, open-source modelling development environment for UML-RT systems. It allows the generation of complete, executable code from models and advances the state-of-art via support for model representation with mixed graphical/textual notations and an extensible code generator. Uisng MDebugger, we can debug the UML-RT models on the target platfrom without using program debugger or refering to the generated code. The core of the MDebugger is developed at model-level uisng model transformation techniques. The more information about how MDebugger is developed can be found in our [FSE 2017] paper.


## Starting Guide:
### Virtual Machine

To facilitate the researchers and developers to use MDebugger, we prepare a virtual machine (VirtualBox VM) which including MDebugger source  and all required software (e.g., PapyrusRT).

We set up the credential, “....” as the username and “...” as the password, for the VM. The source code directory of MDebugger is /home/...../MDebugger/... 
The PapyrusRT is insatled at /home/.../../

All the source are configured as Eclipse project and can be accessed by running PapyrusRT(/home/../). You can change and build the code using inside PapyrusRT.
