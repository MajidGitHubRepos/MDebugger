### Goal of the project
MDebugger is a model-level debugger which provides debugging services by interacting with the debuggable binary.
It consists of several components including a core component,a command interface, an event manager, and a communication
layer. The core component implements the main logic of the debugger. Initially, it queries the list of the registered capsule
instances from the debugging agent. For every capsule instance, it keeps track of certain data including: 1) last events
generated by the capsule, 2) the active state or transition, 3) the list of attributes, their type and value, 4) the execution
mode (e.g., stepping or suspended), 5) the list of breakpoints set, and 6) the debugging command history related to the
capsule instance. In contrast to program debuggers, the list of events represents the stack of a program, the active state
corresponds to the instruction pointer, and the list of variables corresponds to the heap of a program.
In addition to the core component, the communication layer provides services for reading from and writing to the shared memory, and for handling TCP connections. The
command interface is responsible for receiving and parsing the debugging commands from the command line interface
or from external applications connected via TCP.
